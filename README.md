first step of building an application

This is about an accomodation rent Project where u can rent accomodation from anywhere just by using your phone or computer at very affordable prices. You can browser through and filter depending your preferenses/amneties.

Console Application:

This is a commmand line interpreter that is going to work as the interface for the project before we build the html, css and javaScript.
With the console App, we shall be able to create, retrive/show, update, perform functions and delete objects from our backend.

The Interpreter is a Python Script that is excutable on a terminal by running (./console.py), some of the helpfull commands are (help) that can help display all commands you can execute within this console App and quit it with quit.

We shall be using file storage as our database before we create the SQL database and here files will be stored in json file format.

Thank you and enjoy playing with it.
